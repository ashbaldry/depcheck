checkFunctionUse(function_name, code, package_name = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{function_name}{Name of the function to check against}

\item{code}{A character vector of code chunks to check for function use}

}
\description{
Counting the frequency that a function is called within selected code.

where the function is used, but is explicitly called from another package.
